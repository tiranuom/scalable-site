Web - A simplified history
==========================

From the wheel to the super computer, all the technologies we use today is created to solve a problem. The understanding of the underlying problem always helpful on understanding the technology itself. The internet provides an open medium of communication between computing devices. It consists of multiple services like email services, File sharing, streaming etc.. using various protocols. The topics related to this book are a subset of the internet, related to the problem of information publication and information sharing. The target technology is the world wide web, mainly. We are going to touch upon the other related areas like hybrid mobile application development also as it shares some of the similarities with the web. 

Learning the history of a technology is also valuable to understand the technology. It provides proper insight of the constraints and limitations of the solution. And it always provides us a way of understanding the flows of the technology; where it went wrong, and makes us sympathize the pioneers of the technology on their decision making. 

All the web related technology developments started with sir Tim Berners-Leeâ€™s greatest inventions;
HTML: Hypertext markup language
URI: Uniform resource identifier
HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol.
He wrote his first web browser/editor and the first http server (httpd) in 1990. The full story of the initial web development can be found in  (https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/) and (http://www.nethistory.info/index.html) 

HTML
----

Html was created with the simplicity and low learning curve in mind, so that not only the geeky developers, the non-technical people were also could use the technology with ease. This results the wide adaptation of the technology. At the time of development, xml is one of the famous data formats and the hypertext (linking text file to another) feature could be easily implemented with it. Furthermore, the web browsers were written in a forgiving way so that small mistakes by the author are neglected. 

There were no specific standard way of styling the content. The authority styling was left with the web browser authors to deside.
